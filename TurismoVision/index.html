                    The result of a partnership between Ferrari and the Gran Turismo™ video game series, 
                    the spectacular Vision Gran Turismo is a futuristic single-seater sporting a more 
                    extreme version of the V6 engine adopted on the 296 GTB, 296 GTS and 296 GT3 and 
                    that also powers the new Ferrari 499P hypercar that will be seen at Le Mans next year.

                    In this, the 25th year of the Gran Turismo™ video games, 
                    Ferrari was tasked by the smash-hit series founder Kazunori Yamauchi to 
                    "Design your rendition of the ideal GT for us." The result is jaw-dropping, 
                    and sure to be one of the most popular vehicles in the game.

                    The Vision Gran Turismo is designed to be incredibly aerodynamic, with the rear wing, 
                    diffuser and air vents on the wheelarches all carefully designed to give as much 
                    downforce as possible, while a 3 litre, V6 hybrid engine combines with three electric 
                    motors to provide a massive 1356cv.

            <h3>Engine</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Model: 2015 Infiniti Vision GT Supercar Concept.<br>
                Engine/Motor: V8
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Interior</h3>
            <p class="text">
                This car features the most customized, luxurious interior that your rent check can buy. 
                We’re imagining ample seating, lots of headroom, plenty of lighting, oodles of storage, 
                solid plumbing, and a kitchen. That’s because the interior is basically wherever you 
                happen to be playing Gran Tursimo 6. As for details in-game; use your imagination. 
                We’re thinking bucket seats, six-point harnesses, and acres of carbon.

            <h3>Exterior</h3>
            <p class="text">
                One look at the front end on this thing, and you know it’s an Infiniti. 
                It’s like a Q50 hit the sheets with a hammerhead shark, then put the progeny through 10 years of race school. 
                As we all know, a concept is supposed to look good. However, despite the virtual nature of its availability, 
                Infiniti actually took it upon itself to pour technical analysis and number crunching into the concept, 
                calculating stuff like aerodynamics: “the under-floor airflow control, front and back diffusers, 
                and uniquely shaped rear spoiler enables this car to demonstrate high performance without compromising 
                the impact of the body design.” It’s sleek, stylish, and functional, which makes for one helluva combo.
            </p>

            <h3>Drive Terrain</h3>
            <p class="text">
                In addition to technical development for the aero, Infiniti put numbers to the engine and suspension as well. 
                The Vision concept uses a naturally aspirated, 4.5-liter, V-8 engine paired with an electric motor to create 
                a front mid-ship/trans-axle powertrain, with every ounce of juice sent directly to the rear wheels. 
                The electric motor is great for torque at low speeds, while the V-8 practically revs forever. Weight 
                distribution is designed 45:55 front to back, which “fills users with the joy of driving by actively 
                drifting the rear.” As for the handling characteristics, Infiniti put several “young engineers with 
                great driving skills” to task completing countless virtual test laps while refining the on-track 
                behavior of the Vision concept. Sounds like a good day at the office.
